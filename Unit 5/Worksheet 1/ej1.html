		Did you ever hear the tragedy of <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Plagueis">Darth Plagueis The Wise</a>? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It's a Sith legend. <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Plagueis">Darth Plagueis</a> was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 
	</p>
	<p>
		He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine">his apprentice</a> everything he knew, then <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine">his apprentice</a> killed him in his sleep. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Ironic. He could save others from death, but not <a href="https://www.google.com/">himself</a>.
